# Nashville_Real_Estate

## Executive Summary
This project will serve as an overall analysis of the current home real estate market in Nashville, and the ratings given to the schools in the areas where homes are currently for sale.  Data will be extracted from the Zillow real estate website for home prices and Greatschools.org for the school ratings.  

The motivation for this project is to find if there is a correlation between higher home prices and higher school ratings, and transversely, lower home prices and lower school ratings.

## Motivation
My motivation for this project is an opportunity to research, organize, and provide information regarding any correlation between the current price of real estate and the level of education in the greater Nashville, Davidson County area.  

## Data Question
Currently, is there a correlation to be made between housing prices and quality of education in the area?  A known assumption when beginning this project is that with a growing population, there is currently a healthy real estate market in the Nashville, Davidson County area.   

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
I would like my MVP to include a map of the current single-family homes for sale including their locations and asking prices, and the nearby K-12 schools including their location and school rating.  

In the presentation I will include where the data was sourced and how it was refined, how the different data sets are joined, and the use of interactive, layered maps.

## Data Sources
Zillow, Greatschools.org

## Known Issues and Challenges
An API key was procured in order to source the information from the Zillow website.
